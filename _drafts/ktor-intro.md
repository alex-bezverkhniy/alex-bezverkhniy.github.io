In this short tutorial I am going to introduce new Kotlin framework - [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).
Since I started using Kotlin on my FT project I am faling in love to this language deeper and deeper.
There are so many [awesome stuff](https://kotlin.link/) already implemented on kitlin 
but recently I found another cool framework [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).

   > Ktor is an asynchronous framework for creating microservices, web applications, and more. Itâ€™s fun, free, and open source.
