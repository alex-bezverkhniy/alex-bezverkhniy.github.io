title: Introduction or My Verry First Post
---

In this blog I collect my posts/tutorials/best practices related with programming process. I am going to organize my posts in several levels according to level of programming knowlage which will help you to dive in to wonderfull world of programming.

The easiest way to learn programming is to combine two approaches theoretical and practical. In other words you learn some theory and then try it in the real example. Therefore I am going to use a lot of examples which you can run online dirrectly from the page ([REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)).

Here is the example of JavaSript:
<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/sexahem/embed?js,console">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?4.1.2"></script>

So read, learn, "play code" and have fun!
