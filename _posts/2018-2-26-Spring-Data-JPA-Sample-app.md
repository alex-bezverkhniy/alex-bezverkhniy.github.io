In this post I am going to demonstrate common methods and approaches of working with [Spring Data JPA](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/). _Spring Data JPA_ is a part of the big family [Spring Data](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data). _Spring Data_ is the most popular project in set of _Spring Tools_. This project allows us to build fully configuring the persistence layer. I am going to demonstrate and do some code explanation of boilerplate code.
